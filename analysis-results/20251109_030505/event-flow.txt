**Race conditions identified in operator-controller.ts:**

1. **Retry Count Race (lines 612-638)**: Multiple concurrent events could read/increment retry counts simultaneously, causing lost increments.

2. **Event Status Updates (lines 569-593)**: Concurrent `completeEvent`/`failEvent` calls for same eventId could overwrite each other's database updates.

3. **Cell Status Updates (lines 137-144, 183-190, 223-230)**: Multiple operators could update same cell status concurrently without coordination.

4. **Database Transaction Missing**: Event completion/failure updates (lines 571-576, 586-590) aren't atomic with retry operations.

5. **Singleton State**: Controller instance creation (lines 707-711) isn't thread-safe - multiple threads could create multiple instances.

**Critical areas**: Retry logic, event status management, and cell updates lack proper synchronization mechanisms.
