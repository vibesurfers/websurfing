❌ **HALLUCINATION** - Cannot verify Section 5 OPERATOR SELECTION LOGIC because CODEBASE_SUMMARY.MD file does not exist.

However, I can verify the actual operator selection logic in the code:

**Lines 194-244 (selectOperator method)**: ✅ **ACCURATE**
- Contains proper switch statement for event types
- Handles "user_cell_edit", "robot_cell_update", and "manual_trigger" cases
- Returns operator names: "google_search", "url_context", "structured_output", "function_calling"

**Lines 196-213**: ✅ **ACCURATE** 
- Cell edit logic checks for search queries, URLs, defaults to structured_output

**Lines 215-238**: ✅ **ACCURATE**
- Manual trigger logic maps trigger types to operators correctly

**Lines 251-274**: ✅ **ACCURATE**  
- google_search input preparation with query processing and context awareness

**Lines 276-301**: ✅ **ACCURATE**
- url_context input preparation with URL extraction and contextual prompts

**Lines 303-320**: ✅ **ACCURATE**
- structured_output preparation using row data context

The code exists and logic matches what would be expected, but cannot verify against non-existent CODEBASE_SUMMARY.MD.
