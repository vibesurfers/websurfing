Based on my verification of the actual code against Section 6 CONTEXT-AWARE INPUT PREPARATION in the CODEBASE_SUMMARY.MD, here's my analysis:

**Lines 251-273 (operator-controller.ts)** ✅ ACCURATE
- Documentation matches actual code implementation
- Shows correct google_search case with context prompt building
- Query construction with `ColumnAwareWrapper.buildContextualPrompt()` is accurate

**Lines 303-318 (operator-controller.ts)** ✅ ACCURATE  
- Documentation correctly shows structured_output case
- Row data aggregation logic matches implementation
- Filter and map operations for building `${colTitle}: ${value}` format are correct

**Lines 53-77 (column-aware-wrapper.ts)** ✅ ACCURATE
- `buildContextualPrompt` method signature and implementation match exactly
- Format with GOAL, COLUMN STRUCTURE, and TASK sections is correct
- Arrow marker logic `idx === ctx.currentColumnIndex + 1 ? '→ ' : '  '` is accurate
- Current value display format `(current: "${ctx.rowData[idx]}")` is correct

All line references in Section 6 are accurate representations of the actual codebase implementation.
