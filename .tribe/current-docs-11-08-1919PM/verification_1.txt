CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md doesn't exist. Cannot verify Section 1 against it. 

For the code I can read:

**Lines 296-323**: ✅ ACCURATE - onUpdate handler parses table HTML, extracts cell contents, and calls debouncedCellUpdate

**Lines 266-271**: ✅ ACCURATE - updateCell.mutate call with sheetId, rowIndex, colIndex, content parameters  

**Lines 194-282**: ✅ ACCURATE - debouncedCellUpdate function with debouncing, robot update handling, confirmation dialog logic, and cell clearing

**Line 53**: ✅ ACCURATE - processingRows state as Set<number>

**Lines 66-78**: ✅ ACCURATE - updateCell mutation with onSuccess adding to processingRows and onError logging

Cannot verify descriptions without CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md file.
