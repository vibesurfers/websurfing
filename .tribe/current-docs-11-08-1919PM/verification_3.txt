Now I'll verify each line reference from Section 3 BACKGROUND EVENT PROCESSOR against the actual code:

## Section 3 BACKGROUND EVENT PROCESSOR Verification:

**startup.ts:5-17** ❌ HALLUCINATION
- Line 5-17 shows `startServerServices()` function, but the summary claims lines 5-17 when the function is actually lines 5-17. However, the line range is accurate.
- ✅ ACCURATE: Function exists at correct lines

**background-processor.ts:105-109** ✅ ACCURATE
- Lines 105-109 show `startBackgroundProcessor()` function that calls `getBackgroundProcessor().start()`

**background-processor.ts:8** ✅ ACCURATE
- Line 8 shows `private pollInterval = 1000;`

**background-processor.ts:33-43** ✅ ACCURATE  
- Lines 33-43 show the `processLoop()` method with while loop and sleep

**background-processor.ts:41** ✅ ACCURATE
- Line 41 shows `await this.sleep(this.pollInterval);`

**background-processor.ts:46-50** ✅ ACCURATE
- Lines 46-50 show the SQL query for pending events with LIMIT 50

**background-processor.ts:58-65** ✅ ACCURATE
- Lines 58-65 show the Map-based grouping logic by sheetId

**background-processor.ts:79-83** ✅ ACCURATE  
- Lines 79-83 show `updateSheet(userId, sheetId)` call with `.finally()` cleanup

**background-processor.ts:88** ✅ ACCURATE
- Line 88 shows `await Promise.allSettled(processingPromises);`

All line references in Section 3 are **ACCURATE** ✅
